# Fight Fascists

This is a repository trying to help you fight fascists.

## Important safety note
**Always put the safety of yourself and your family first! Fascists are dangerous people. If you feel unsafe, do not engage. It's ok to walk away!**  
However, you can still read through this repository and activate a DNS blocklist, for example. This will help you stay safe online and shield you from fascist content.

If you can, **please contribute!**  
This repo absolutely relies on contributions.
